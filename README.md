# js-snake-game
Play the game using the arrow keys, eat as much food without crashing into yourself or the borders. Start the game by pressing any arrow key.

Snake game made with JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Used CSS grid for the game board. I saved the snakes speed, expansion rate and the grid in const variables to make it easy to change the size and speed of the game by only changing the variables.

*Learned to use requestAnimationFrame to render and set the time for the game to run. 
*Got a better understanding on how to split JS code using modules for a cleaner and easier to read code.
