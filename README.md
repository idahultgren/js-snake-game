# js-snake-game
Snake game made with JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

Used CSS grid for the game board. I saved the snakes speed, expansion rate and the grid in const variables to make it easy to change the size and speed of the game by only changing the variables.

*Learned to use requestAnimationFrame to render and set the time for the game to run. 
*Got a better understanding on how to split JS code using modules for a cleaner and easier to read code.
